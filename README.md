## An E-Commerce site built with React
This is an assignment where I built an accommodation website built with React. On this site you can view, post and book venues. As a guest you can view the venues and a specific venue, but you have to register or login to be able to book at one. You can register as a venue manager and be able to post your own venues.

On this site, I have used:
* React hook form and yup for forms
* Styled components for styling

## How to use
* Clone the repo
* Commands to start with:
```npm i```
```npm run start```

## I built this project with:
<div align="left">
<a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/512px-React-icon.svg.png" alt="React" height="50"/></a>
